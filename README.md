## Course objectives

-   Discuss advantages and limitations of structural econometric models.
    Give students an understanding of why and when adding structure is
    important.

-   Provide insights into strategy (especially, identification) in
    important papers in structural Labour, Public & IO literature. Give
    a feel of how one may go about establishing a structural model.

-   Establish basic estimation techniques & numerical methods such as
    Simulation, Numerical integration and Discretisation.

-   Develop matrix programming skills using Matlab. Loops vs.
    vectorisation; readability vs. speed; sustainable coding for several
    projects.
